#+title: Ondim - multitype expansions for easy templating

Ondim is a library for creating templating engines for arbitrary formats, inspired by Heist (which only works for HTML). It also includes HTML, Pandoc, LaTeX and Whiskers (a new template language very similar to Mustache) targets that work out-of-the-box. 

The main idea is to reuse existing libraries that will provide the target  language's parser, types and renderer, and easily build an "expansion" layer on top. If you are familiar with Heist, for HTML this is done by binding /named expansions/ (in Heist they are called Splices) that programatically transform the contents of HTML elements whose tags match the name.

For instance, this is how you could define an if/else expansion with ~Ondim~:
#+begin_src haskell
ifElse :: (Monad m, OndimNode t) => Bool -> Expansion m t
ifElse cond node = do
  let els = children node
      yes = filter ((Just "else" /=) . identify) els
      no =
        maybe [] children $
          find ((Just "else" ==) . identify) els
  if cond
    then liftNodes yes
    else liftNodes no
#+end_src

Now, suppose you have a variable ~isCat :: Bool~ and you want your templates to choose between two snippets depending on its value. Such HTML template could have type ~[HtmlNode]~, so that if you "lift" it into the Ondim monad binding ~ifElse isCat~ to the name ~if-cat~,

#+begin_src haskell
liftNodes myTemplateContent
  `binding` do
    "if-cat" #* ifElse isCat
#+end_src

you can now write in your HTML templates...

#+begin_src html
<if-cat>
  <p>I have a <i>beautiful</i> cat!</p>
  <else>
    <p>I don't have a cat ðŸ˜­</p>
  </else>
</if-cat>
#+end_src

...and the output will depend on the value of ~isCat~.

The beauty of ondim (and one aspect that takes it further from Heist) is that the ~ifElse~ splice is polymorphic on the format type, so the same code works for formats other than HTML. In a Pandoc setting, the same code above would work if src_haskell{myTemplateContent} had type src_haskell{[Block]}, and the same template could be written as:
#+begin_src markdown
::: if-cat
I have a _beautiful_ cat!

:::: else
I don't have a cat :sob:
::::
:::
#+end_src
This is written in plain Pandoc markdown, and meant to be parsed by the Pandoc reader itself. Note that instead of HTML tags, now we annotate the expansions with [[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-fenced_divs][fenced divs]] and [[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-bracketed_spans][bracketed spans]].

But HTML and Pandoc are just examples, each defined in very few lines of code under =Ondim.Targets.HTML= and =Ondim.Targets.Pandoc=. And due to the use of =multiwalk='s generics, most of it is instantiating generic instances. Ondim makes it easy to define your own!
